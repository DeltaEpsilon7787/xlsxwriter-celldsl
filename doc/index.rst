XlsxWriter Cell DSL
===================

Description
-----------
XlsxWriter-CellDSL is a complementary Python module for the excellent `XlsxWriter`_ library
that provides a DSL (domain specific language) to perform common operations in worksheets
without having to specify absolute coordinates and keep track of them,
instead opting to use primarily relative movement of an imaginary "cursor" within the spreadsheet,
among other things.
